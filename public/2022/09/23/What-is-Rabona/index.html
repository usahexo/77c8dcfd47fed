            <h1 id="What-is-Rabona"><a href="#What-is-Rabona" class="headerlink" title="What is Rabona?"></a>What is Rabona?</h1><p>Rabona is a type of kick that is used in association football. It is an unusual move that involves kicking the ball with the inside of the foot - around the ankle area - instead of using the laces.</p>
<p>The rabona has been used by some of the best players in the world, including Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar. It is a difficult move to execute and can catch defenders off guard.</p>
<h1 id="When-was-Rabona-Invented"><a href="#When-was-Rabona-Invented" class="headerlink" title="When was Rabona Invented?"></a>When was Rabona Invented?</h1><p>There is some debate over when the rabona was first invented, with some sources saying it originated in Argentina in the 1940s. However, there are also reports of Italian players using the move in the 1930s.</p>
<p>Regardless of when it was first invented, the rabona has become increasingly popular in recent years, thanks to some of the top players using it to great effect.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-do-a-Rabona-Kick"><a href="#How-to-do-a-Rabona-Kick" class="headerlink" title="How to do a Rabona Kick?"></a>How to do a Rabona Kick?</h1><p>There are different ways to do a rabona kick, but all involve kicking the ball with the inside of your foot around the ankle area. Here is one way to do it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start by standing with your weaker foot facing forwards and your stronger foot behind you.</li>
<li>Bend down slightly and place your stronger foot behind and slightly above the ball. </li>
<li>Bring your weaker foot up towards your stronger foot and kick the ball with your inside of your foot - around the ankle area. </li>
<li>Keep your eyes on the ball until it goes out of bounds or you score!</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="What-is-Valencia-CF"><a href="#What-is-Valencia-CF" class="headerlink" title="What is Valencia CF?"></a>What is Valencia CF?</h1><p>Valencia Club de Fútbol, commonly known as Valencia CF or simply Valencia, is a Spanish football club based in Valencia. They play in La Liga and are one of the most successful and biggest clubs in Spain.</p>
<p>The club was formed in 1919 and spent their early years playing in the regional leagues before being promoted to the national leagues in 1928. They have won La Liga twice, the Copa del Rey six times and the UEFA Cup twice. They reached the final of the Champions League in 2001 but lost to Bayern Munich.</p>
<p>Valencia play their home games at the Estadio Mestalla which has a capacity of 55,000. The club are currently managed by Marcelino García Toral.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-Pound"><a href="#What-is-Pound" class="headerlink" title="What is Pound?"></a>What is Pound?</h1><p>Pound (symbol: $) is a unit of currency that was used in the United States from 1792 until 1857. It was divided into 240 pence.</p>
<p>The dollar was replaced by the gold dollar in 1873. The gold dollar was replaced by the Federal Reserve Note in 1913.</p>
<p>The symbol $ derives from the Latin word “solidus”. The solidus was a gold coin used in the Roman Empire.</p>
<h1 id="What-does-Rabona-mean-in-Spanish"><a href="#What-does-Rabona-mean-in-Spanish" class="headerlink" title="What does Rabona mean in Spanish?"></a>What does Rabona mean in Spanish?</h1><p>Rabona is a Spanish word that means ‘to kick with the outside of the foot.’ This term is most commonly used in association with a football move that sees a player kicking the ball behind their standing leg with the outside of their other foot.</p>
<h1 id="How-did-Valencia-CF-and-Pound-come-to-be-associated-with-Rabona"><a href="#How-did-Valencia-CF-and-Pound-come-to-be-associated-with-Rabona" class="headerlink" title="How did Valencia CF and Pound come to be associated with Rabona?"></a>How did Valencia CF and Pound come to be associated with Rabona?</h1><p>The rabona is a type of kick in association football, invented by Argentine player Enrique Omar Sívori. The kick involves striking the ball behind the kicking leg with the trailing foot, then quickly bringing that foot up and around the ball to hit it on the other side.</p>
<p>The term “rabona” is derived from the Spanish word “rabonar”, which means “to do a rabona”. It was given this name because of Argentinian player Enrique Omar Sívori’s habit of performing the move.</p>
<p>There are many famous players who have successfully pulled off a rabona during their career, including Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar and Gareth Bale. One of the most famous examples of a successful rabona is Diego Maradona’s goal against England at the 1986 World Cup.</p>
<p>Rabonas are often used as a showboating trick or as a way to surprise the opposing goalkeeper. They are not always successful, however, as John Terry’s missed attempt for Chelsea in their Champions League semi-final against Barcelona in 2009 demonstrated.</p>
<p>Despite its occasional success, the rabona remains a risky move and can often result in an embarrassing own goal if it goes wrong. As former Juventus and Italy striker Alessandro Del Piero once said: “The rabona is like sex – even when it’s bad, it’s still good.”</p>
