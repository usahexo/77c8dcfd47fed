            <h1 id="1970-The-Beginning-of-Casino-Royale"><a href="#1970-The-Beginning-of-Casino-Royale" class="headerlink" title="1970- The Beginning of Casino Royale"></a>1970- The Beginning of Casino Royale</h1><p>Casino Royale is a 1967 British spy comedy film originally produced by Columbia Pictures starring David Niven, Peter Sellers, Ursula Andress and Orson Welles. It is based on the novel of the same name by Ian Fleming. The film’s tagline reads: “All the excitement of James Bond in one film!”</p>
<p>The original Casino Royale was released in 1954 and starred Barry Nelson as an American agent. This version is unrelated to the 1967 film.</p>
<p>The 1967 film was the sixth and final Eon Productions film to star Sean Connery as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. After George Lazenby briefly assumed the role in On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, Connery was coaxed out of retirement to play Bond once more in Diamonds Are Forever (1971).</p>
<p>Principal photography for Casino Royale took place from 17 January to 19 March 1967 at the Pinewood Studios in London. The early scenes were shot at Blenheim Palace, which served as Bond’s country home; location shooting also took place at Ascot Racecourse and the casino at Royale-les-Eaux in France.</p>
<p>It was an immensely popular movie on release, making over $141 million worldwide, and received largely positive reviews from critics who, while differing on specific points, agreed that it was one of the best entries in the series up to that point. Several retrospective reviews have been positive, praising its humour and entertainment value.</p>
<h1 id="The-Plot"><a href="#The-Plot" class="headerlink" title="The Plot"></a>The Plot</h1><p>In Casino Royale, Bond initially struggles against SMERSH operative Le Chiffre (Orson Welles), losing all his money in a high-stakes poker game at the casino in Royale-les-Eaux. He is later informed that Le Chiffre has kidnapped James’ love interest, Vesper Lynd (Ursula Andress), in order to force him to recoup his losses by playing against her in a final poker game. MI6 enters into an arrangement with international banker Mr. White (Peter Sellers) to track down and neutralise Le Chiffre should he lose again. Bond pursues Lynd to Montenegro where he uncovers a terrorist plot aimed at Montenegro’s apparent ally in NATO, Britain.</p>

Under his leadership, the casino saw a huge increase in profits. This was due to Rothstein’s unique approach to managing the casino. He was able to keep tight control over the games and employees, while also ensuring that customers had a positive experience. This helped to create a loyal customer base, which resulted in higher profits for the casino.</p>
<h1 id="1984-Construction-Finished-on-the-Tangiers-Casino"><a href="#1984-Construction-Finished-on-the-Tangiers-Casino" class="headerlink" title="1984- Construction Finished on the Tangiers Casino"></a>1984- Construction Finished on the Tangiers Casino</h1><p>The Tangiers Casino was opened in 1984 on the Las Vegas strip. The casino’s architecture was inspired by the North African city of Tangiers and it featured a unique design which included a winding roof line and Moroccan-themed decor.</p>
<p>The Tangiers Casino was initially owned and operated by entrepreneur Howard Hughes, but it was later sold to American businessman Steve Wynn in 1988. Wynn made extensive renovations to the property and he renamed it the Mirage Resort and Casino. The Mirage Resort and Casino quickly became one of the most popular casinos on the Las Vegas strip.</p>
<p>The Tangiers Casino was a significant part of Las Vegas history and it will be remembered for its unique architecture and its role in the development of the Mirage Resort and Casino.</p>
<h1 id="1987-The-Death-of-Frank-Rosenthal"><a href="#1987-The-Death-of-Frank-Rosenthal" class="headerlink" title="1987- The Death of Frank Rosenthal"></a>1987- The Death of Frank Rosenthal</h1><p>In 1987, during a meeting with some of his fellow mobsters, Frank Rosenthal was killed by a car bomb. Rosenthal had been head of the Chicago Outfit’s operations in Las Vegas and had been making moves to expand his empire into other states. His death marked the end of an era for the Outfit and paved the way for younger, more ambitious members to take over.</p>
<h1 id="1990-The-End-of-the-Tangiers-Casino"><a href="#1990-The-End-of-the-Tangiers-Casino" class="headerlink" title="1990- The End of the Tangiers Casino"></a>1990- The End of the Tangiers Casino</h1><p>The Tangiers Casino in Las Vegas was a popular casino in the 1990s. However, it closed down in 1990.</p>
<p>The Tangiers was known for its high-limit games and its luxurious decor. It was originally opened by businessman Philip Green in 1989. However, it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection just one year later. The bankruptcy protection was due to the high cost of running the casino, as well as its low gaming revenue.</p>
<p>In 1990, the Tangiers Casino was sold to Sam Cohen for $82 million. Cohen had plans to reopen the casino, but he died before he could do so. In 1995, the casino reopened under new ownership, but it closed down again just two years later.</p>
<p>Today, the site of the Tangiers Casino is occupied by The Drew Las Vegas hotel and casino.</p>
