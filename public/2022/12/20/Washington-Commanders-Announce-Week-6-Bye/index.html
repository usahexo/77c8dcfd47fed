            <h1 id="Washington-Commanders-Announce-Week-6-Bye"><a href="#Washington-Commanders-Announce-Week-6-Bye" class="headerlink" title="Washington Commanders Announce Week 6 Bye"></a>Washington Commanders Announce Week 6 Bye</h1><p>The Washington Commanders announced on Monday that they will be taking a week 6 bye. This comes as a surprise to many, as the Commanders have been one of the most successful teams in the XFL thus far.</p>
<p>With a record of 4-0, the Commanders have looked like one of the strongest teams in the league. However, their roster is filled with talent, and they feel they can afford to take a week off without losing too much ground.</p>
<p>“We’re taking this bye week to make sure that we’re 100% ready for the playoffs,” said head coach Pep Hamilton. “There are no guarantees in this league, and we want to make sure that we’re at our best when it matters most.”</p>
<p>This decision is sure to raise some eyebrows in the league, but it is clear that the Washington Commanders are doing everything they can to win a championship.</p>
<h1 id="Washington-Commanders-Earn-First-Win-of-the-Season"><a href="#Washington-Commanders-Earn-First-Win-of-the-Season" class="headerlink" title="Washington Commanders Earn First Win of the Season"></a>Washington Commanders Earn First Win of the Season</h1><p>The Washington Commanders earned their first win of the season in a dominant performance against the Birmingham Iron. The Commanders defense was relentless, forcing 3 turnovers and limiting the Iron to only 277 total yards.</p>
<p>Offensively, Washington was led by quarterback Cardale Jones, who completed 16 of his 25 passes for 256 yards and 2 touchdowns. Receiver Terry McLaurin had a huge game, catching 7 passes for 141 yards and 2 touchdowns.</p>
<p>This was a big win for Washington, who will look to build on it as they continue their inaugural season in the AAF.</p>
<h1 id="Washington-Commanders-Ready-for-Rematch-Against-Seattle-Seahawks"><a href="#Washington-Commanders-Ready-for-Rematch-Against-Seattle-Seahawks" class="headerlink" title="Washington Commanders Ready for Rematch Against Seattle Seahawks"></a>Washington Commanders Ready for Rematch Against Seattle Seahawks</h1><p>The Washington Commanders are gearing up for their rematch against the Seattle Seahawks after losing to them in Week 1. The Seahawks jumped out to an early lead, but the Commanders fought back and had a chance to win in the final minutes.</p>
<p>“We played them pretty close in the first game, so I think we have a good chance of winning this time,” said quarterback Cardale Jones.</p>
<p>Jones has been one of the team’s standout players so far this season. He has thrown for over 1,000 yards and 9 touchdowns, and he is currently third in the league in passing yards.</p>
<p>The Commanders will need to continue to play well on offense if they want to beat the Seahawks. In addition to Jones, they will also need to get production from running back James Conner and wide receiver Sterling Shepard.</p>
<p>Seattle has one of the best defenses in the NFL, so the Commanders will need to be patient and take what the defense gives them. If they can do that, they have a good chance of coming away with a victory on Sunday.</p>
<h1 id="Washington-Commanders-Top-Dallas-Cowboys-in-Thrilling-Overtime-Victory"><a href="#Washington-Commanders-Top-Dallas-Cowboys-in-Thrilling-Overtime-Victory" class="headerlink" title="Washington Commanders Top Dallas Cowboys in Thrilling Overtime Victory"></a>Washington Commanders Top Dallas Cowboys in Thrilling Overtime Victory</h1><p>In a thrilling game that went into overtime, the Washington Commanders topped the Dallas Cowboys 26-20.</p>
<p>Washington got off to a hot start, scoring on their first two possessions to take a 14-0 lead. Dallas was able to respond with a touchdown of their own before halftime, making the score 14-7 in favor of Washington.</p>
<p>The Cowboys took the lead in the third quarter, but Washington was able to tie it up late in the fourth to send it into overtime.</p>
<p>In addition to the touchdown pass from Cardale Jones to Trey Williams, Washington’s defense came up big, intercepting Dak Prescott twice.</p>
<p>This was Washington’s first victory of the season, and it snapped a two-game losing streak for Dallas.</p>
<h1 id="Washington-Commanders-Fall-to-Los-Angeles-Rams-in-Close-Game"><a href="#Washington-Commanders-Fall-to-Los-Angeles-Rams-in-Close-Game" class="headerlink" title="Washington Commanders Fall to Los Angeles Rams in Close Game"></a>Washington Commanders Fall to Los Angeles Rams in Close Game</h1><p>The Washington Commanders showed great effort in their matchup against the Los Angeles Rams, but ultimately fell short by a final score of 21-19.</p>
<p>Washington quarterback Cardale Jones had an impressive game, throwing for 292 yards and two touchdowns. Wide receiver Jamison Crowder was his favorite target, hauling in seven catches for 125 yards and a touchdown.</p>
<p>However, the Washington defense couldn’t stop Rams running back Todd Gurley, who rushed for 145 yards and two touchdowns on 27 carries.</p>
<p>In the end, it wasn’t enough as the Commanders fell to 1-3 on the season.</p>
