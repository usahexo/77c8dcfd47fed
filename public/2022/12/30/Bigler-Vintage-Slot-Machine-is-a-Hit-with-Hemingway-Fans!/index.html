<p>The museum is the creation of casino industry veteran and historian William Bigler, who has spent more than 10 years restoring and collecting antique slot machines.</p>
<p>“This is a dream come true for me,” said Bigler. “I’ve been fascinated by these machines since I was a kid, and I’m thrilled to be able to share them with the public.”</p>
<p>The museum is located in historic downtown Gold Hill, Colorado and is open from 9:00am to 5:00pm Monday through Saturday. Admission is free.</p>
<p>The museum features a wide variety of antique slot machines, including models from such iconic brands as Mills, Jennings, Pace and Caille. There are even a few rare specimens, including a 1900 Liberty Bell machine and a 1933 one-armed bandit.</p>

<p>A museum in Florida has acquired a slot machine that was once owned by the author Ernest Hemingway.</p>
<p>The machine was a part of Hemingway’s estate and was sold at an auction after his death. It is now on display at the Key West Museum of Art and History.</p>
<p>Museum officials say that the machine is a significant addition to their collection and provides an interesting look into the life of one of America’s most celebrated authors.</p>
<p>Hemingway was known for his love of casinos and gambling, and it is believed that he acquired the slot machine in the late 1940s. The machine remained in his possession until his death in 1961.</p>
<p>According to family members, Hemingway would often sit at the machine for hours, playing slots and drinking whiskey. They say that he was rarely successful at winning, but he never seemed to mind.</p>
<p>In fact, Hemingway once wrote about his love of gambling, saying: “I never counted my money when I was winning. I just kept putting it back in my pocket.”</p>
<p>The slot machine is now on display at the Key West Museum of Art and History alongside other items from Hemingway’s estate, including his fishing rod and tackle box.</p>
<h1 id="Bigler-Vintage-Slot-Machine-Goes-to-Auction"><a href="#Bigler-Vintage-Slot-Machine-Goes-to-Auction" class="headerlink" title="Bigler Vintage Slot Machine Goes to Auction"></a>Bigler Vintage Slot Machine Goes to Auction</h1><p>One of the more interesting items set to go up for auction on Saturday is a Bigler vintage slot machine. The slot machine is a rare piece, and is expected to fetch a high price at auction.</p>
<p>The Bigler vintage slot machine was created by the Bigler Machine Company in 1892. The company was founded by Charles W. Bigler, and became one of the leading manufacturers of slot machines in the United States. The company produced a number of different models over the years, but the 1892 model is considered the most rare and valuable.</p>
<p>The Bigler vintage slot machine was first put up for auction in 2002, where it sold for $180,000. The slot machine is expected to sell for even more this time around, with auction house estimates putting the price at anywhere from $225,000 to $275,000.</p>
<p>So why is the Bigler vintage slot machine so valuable? There are a few reasons. First, it’s a rare piece - only a handful have ever been made. Second, it’s in excellent condition - most of them have been lost or destroyed over the years. And finally, it’s part of history - these machines were some of the first ever created, and helped pave the way for modern day slots machines.</p>
