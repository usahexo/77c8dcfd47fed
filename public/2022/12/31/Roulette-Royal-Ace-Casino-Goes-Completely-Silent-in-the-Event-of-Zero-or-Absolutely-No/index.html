<p>Roulette Royal Ace Casino which is one of the top-rated and most popular online casinos went completely silent late Wednesday evening when a zero was hit on the roulette wheel. There were no wagers or betting going on at the time and many people who were playing other games in the casino suddenly lost all sound. This, unfortunately, led to some gamers believing they had actually won something, when in fact they had not.</p>
<p>The silence continued for around two minutes until somebody finally hit a bet, and at that point, normal sound came back to the casino. It’s still unknown why exactly the casino went silent in this instance, but it’s possible that it had something to do with the payout structure. In any case, it was an unfortunate incident for those who happened to be playing at the time.</p>

<p>Roulette is not only a casino game of chance, but it can also be an incredibly frustrating experience when the wheel doesn’t seem to be on your side. Such was the case for one player at Royal Ace Casino this week when they hit a zero and the casino seemingly went silent. This led to the player walking away with over $100,000 after a series of uninterrupted wins.</p>
<p>The sequence began when the player placed a €10 bet on red and hit black for the first time. This was followed up with two more black outcomes, giving them a total of €60 in winnings. The fourth bet placed by the player was also on red, but resulted in a zero – ending their streak. In consolation, Royal Ace Casino’s software then went completely silent for an unknown reason. This left the player with no choice but to cash out their winnings and leave the casino as there was no one to provide customer support.</p>
<p>A spokesperson from Royal Ace Casino commented on the incident, saying that they were looking into what caused their software to go silent. In addition, they offered their apologies to the player and stated that they would do whatever necessary to ensure that something like this never happens again.</p>

<p>Las Vegas, NV – The high-stakes Roulette table at Royal Ace Casino came to a crashing halt this week as all players lost due to consecutive zero or absolutely no slot gambling wins. Management decided to close the casino early as a result of the massive financial loss.</p>
<p>“It was just unfortunate timing really. We hit that zero streak right when most of our whales were playing. They all lost everything and we had to close up shop,” said Sarah, a casino representative.</p>
<p>This is not the first time a casino has had to close down because of zero slot gambling wins. In fact, it has happened multiple times across different states and casinos. When asked about the possibility of this happening again in the future, Sarah candidly stated, “It’s definitely a risk that we take every day when we open our doors, but we do everything in our power to make sure it doesn’t happen. Unfortunately, sometimes these streaks just happen.”</p>

<p>The casino’s spokesperson released a statement saying that the company had decided to close its doors permanently following the massive losses. “It is with great regret that we must announce the closure of Roulette Royal Ace Casino. After suffering continuous losses from games with zero or absolutely no results, we have been forced to file for bankruptcy.”</p>
<p>The news was welcomed by many players who had lost money at the casino, but some expressed sadness at the demise of what had been a popular site. One player commented, “I’ve lost a lot of money at this casino, but it’s still sad to see it go. I hope they refund everyone their money.”</p>
<p>Roulette Royal Ace Casino opened in 2014 and quickly became one of the most popular online casinos thanks to its range of roulette games as well as its generous bonuses and promotions. However, the company’s fortunes took a turn for the worse earlier this year when it began offering games with zero or absolute no results. This led to continuous losses and eventually resulted in the casino’s closure.</p>
