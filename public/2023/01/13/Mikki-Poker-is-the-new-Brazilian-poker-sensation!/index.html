            <h1 id="Mikki-Poker-is-the-new-Brazilian-poker-sensation"><a href="#Mikki-Poker-is-the-new-Brazilian-poker-sensation" class="headerlink" title="Mikki Poker is the new Brazilian poker sensation!"></a>Mikki Poker is the new Brazilian poker sensation!</h1><p>Mikki Poker is the new Brazilian poker sensation, who is making a name for himself in the poker world with some amazing online and live tournament performances.</p>
<p>Mikki first came to attention in the poker world in early 2017, when he finished runner-up in the $215 buy-in Turbo Tuesday event on PokerStars, earning himself a massive $27,762 prize. </p>
<p>A few weeks later, Mikki went one better by taking down the $109 buy-in Sunday Kickoff on PokerStars for an impressive $10,710 payday.</p>
<p>This was followed up by another final table appearance in a major online tournament in May 2017, when Mikki finished 7th in the $1,050 buy-in World Championship of Online Poker (WCOOP) Event #32 for a prize of $14,556. </p>
<p>Mikki has also enjoyed plenty of success live at the casino tables, most notably cashing in two events at the Brazilian Series of Poker (BSOP), taking 4th place in one and 5th place in the other. </p>
<p>With his results so far, Mikki looks destined to become one of Brazil’s most successful poker players and it will be interesting to see how he fares in bigger tournaments over coming months.</p>
<h1 id="Mikki-Poker-is-the-first-Brazilian-woman-to-win-a-WSOP-bracelet"><a href="#Mikki-Poker-is-the-first-Brazilian-woman-to-win-a-WSOP-bracelet" class="headerlink" title="Mikki Poker is the first Brazilian woman to win a WSOP bracelet!"></a>Mikki Poker is the first Brazilian woman to win a WSOP bracelet!</h1><p>On Sunday, July 8th, Mikki Poker won the $1,500 No-Limit Hold’em Shootout event at the World Series of Poker (WSOP), becoming the first Brazilian woman ever to win a WSOP bracelet.</p>
<p>The victory was especially sweet for Poker, who considers Brazil her home country and who has been playing poker since she was just eighteen years old. “It feels really good to win this tournament in my home country,” remarked an elated Poker after her victory. “I have been coming close so many times and it feels great to finally get over the hump.”</p>
<p>Indeed, this was not Poker’s first major victory – she has already won more than $1.5 million in live tournament earnings, including two World Poker Tour (WPT) titles. However, the WSOP bracelet is undoubtedly one of the most prestigious honors in poker – and now Mikki Poker can proudly add it to her list of accomplishments.</p>
<p>In addition to being an accomplished player, Mikki Poker is also known for her giving personality. She has been involved with several charities over the years, including raising money for victims of the devastating earthquake that struck Haiti in 2010.</p>
<p>Mikki Poker is an inspiration to all aspiring poker players, regardless of gender. Her perseverance and determination in the face of adversity are truly admirable, and we can only hope that she will continue to be a role model for aspiring female poker players everywhere. Congratulations, Mikki!</p>
<h1 id="Mikki-Poker-is-on-an-unstoppable-run-in-the-Brazilian-poker-scene"><a href="#Mikki-Poker-is-on-an-unstoppable-run-in-the-Brazilian-poker-scene" class="headerlink" title="Mikki Poker is on an unstoppable run in the Brazilian poker scene!"></a>Mikki Poker is on an unstoppable run in the Brazilian poker scene!</h1><p>There is no stopping Mikki Poker. The Brazilian poker pro is on an unstoppable run in the Brazilian poker scene and shows no signs of slowing down.</p>
<p>Mikki has been playing professionally for over a decade now, and her skills are as sharp as ever. She has racked up an impressive list of accomplishments in Brazilian poker, including becoming the first female to win a major title at the Brazilian Series of Poker (BSOP). Not only that, but she also holds a few other championships under her belt, such as the BSOP Millionaire Maker and the WSOP Circuit Brazil Main Event.</p>
<p>And it looks like Mikki is just getting started! In recent months, she has been crushing her competition in some of Brazil’s biggest tournaments. Just last month, she took down the BSOP Millions event for nearly $200,000, proving that she is one of the best in the business.</p>
<p>If you want to see some top-notch poker action, be sure to check out Mikki Poker in action at one of Brazil’s next big tournaments. You won’t be disappointed!</p>
<h1 id="Mikki-Poker-The-new-queen-of-Brazilian-poker"><a href="#Mikki-Poker-The-new-queen-of-Brazilian-poker" class="headerlink" title="Mikki Poker: The new queen of Brazilian poker?"></a>Mikki Poker: The new queen of Brazilian poker?</h1><p>Mikki poker is a young Brazilian poker player that has been turning heads in the poker world for a few years now.</p>
<p>In 2016, Mikki placed first in the Ladies Event of the Latin American Poker Tour, which was held in Punta del Este, Uruguay. The victory netted her over $40,000 in prize money.</p>
<p>But Mikki’s skills go far beyond just winning tournaments. She is an accomplished cash game player as well, and has taken down some major pots against some of the best players in the world.</p>
<p>In March of 2017, Mikki made a final table at the PokerStars Championship Panama$5,000 No Limit Hold’em event. She finished in 4th place, taking home over $40,000 in prize money.</p>
<p>Mikki’s success can be attributed to her aggressive playing style and her willingness to take risks. This often leads to big pots and exciting showdowns. Her opponents often find themselves on the wrong end of coin flips, which is why she has become known as “The Queen of Brazilian Poker”.</p>
<p>Mikki is currently considered one of the top female poker players in the world, and it won’t be long before she becomes a household name among casual and professional poker players alike.</p>
<h1 id="Could-Mikki-Poker-be-the-next-Brazilian-poker-superstar"><a href="#Could-Mikki-Poker-be-the-next-Brazilian-poker-superstar" class="headerlink" title="Could Mikki Poker be the next Brazilian poker superstar?"></a>Could Mikki Poker be the next Brazilian poker superstar?</h1><p>Mikki poker is a relatively unknown Brazilian player who has been making waves in the online poker world over the past few years. He first came to prominence in 2016 when he won the Sunday Million on PokerStars, taking down a field of 6,487 players and earning $162,915.</p>
<p>Since then, Mikki has continued to impress with some impressive results both online and live. In May 2018, he finished runner-up in the €1,000 buy-in SCOOP High Main Event on PokerStars for $188,598, and in July 2018 he won the €1,000 buy-in Pot-Limit Omaha event at the WSOP Europe for €57,580.</p>
<p>These results have helped Mikki to build up a healthy online poker bankroll of over $1.4 million, which ranks him among the top 10 all-time money earners from Brazil. Mikki is now looking to take his game to the next level and become a household name in the global poker community.</p>
<p>So far, Mikki has shown himself to be an extremely versatile player capable of excelling at a wide range of poker games. His biggest strengths appear to be NLHE and PLO cash games, but he has also demonstrated competency in tournaments and Sit &amp; Go’s.</p>
<p>Given his current level of success and his tremendous upside potential, it’s not hard to see why Mikki poker is being touted as one of Brazil’s brightest young poker stars. If he can continue to put in consistent results over the next few years, there’s no telling how far he could go.</p>
