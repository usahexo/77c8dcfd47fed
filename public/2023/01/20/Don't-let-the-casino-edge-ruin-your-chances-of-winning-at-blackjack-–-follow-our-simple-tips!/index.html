This is because the house can change the rules of the game at any time, and thereby make it harder for players to win.</p>
<p>There are however a number of ways that you can minimise the casino edge, and thereby improve your chances of winning. Here are our top tips:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Always obey the basic blackjack rules. These include not exceeding 21 points, and standing when you have 16 or more. If you don’t follow these rules, you’ll quickly find yourself out of pocket.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Split pairs whenever possible. This increases your chances of getting two winning hands, and can often result in a bigger payout from the casino.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don’t take insurance bets. These bets may seem like a good idea, but they actually give the house an even bigger edge over players.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Avoid card counting. While card counting can give players an advantage over the house, it’s also technically illegal in many jurisdictions. If you’re caught card counting, you could end up getting thrown out of the casino – and losing all your money in the process!</p>
</li>
<li><p>Finally, remember that blackjack is a game of chance. No matter how well you play, there’s always a chance that you’ll lose money in the long run. So don’t gamble more than you can afford to lose, and enjoy yourself while you’re at it!</p>

<h1 id="How-to-play-blackjack-like-a-pro-–-learn-the-basic-rules-and-strategies-here"><a href="#How-to-play-blackjack-like-a-pro-–-learn-the-basic-rules-and-strategies-here" class="headerlink" title="How to play blackjack like a pro – learn the basic rules and strategies here!"></a>How to play blackjack like a pro – learn the basic rules and strategies here!</h1><p>Blackjack is a casino table game that is popular all over the world. The aim of the game is to achieve a hand value of 21, or as close to 21 as possible, without going bust.</p>
<p>If you are new to blackjack, it is important to learn the basic rules and strategies before playing. In this article, we will teach you how to play blackjack like a pro!</p>
<p>The first thing you need to know is the different types of blackjack hands:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two cards of the same rank (e.g. two queens) &#x3D; a pair</li>
<li>Three cards of the same rank (e.g. three kings) &#x3D; a triplet</li>
<li>A card and a combination of two cards with the same rank (e.g. king and queen) &#x3D; a set</li>
</ul>
<p>After you have learned the different types of hands, you need to learn how to calculate your hand value. In blackjack, the Ace can be worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on what makes sense for your hand. All other cards are worth their face value.</p>
<p>To calculate your total hand value, add up the values of all your cards:</p>
<p>&#x3D; 18</p>
<p>Your total hand value in this example is 18. The aim of the game is to get as close to 21 as possible, without going bust (i.e. reaching 22 or more). If your hand value exceeds 21, you automatically lose regardless of what the dealer’s hand value is.</p>
<p>Now that you know how to calculate your total hand value, let’s take a look at some basic blackjack strategy: </p>
<ul>
<li>If your total hand value is 16 or below, always hit (unless you have an Ace). This increases your chances of getting closer to 21 and avoiding busting out.- If your total hand value is 17 or above, always stand (unless you have an Ace). This gives you the best chance of not going bust and beating the dealer’s hand.- When you have two card values that are close together (e.g. 5 and 6), always hit if your total hand value is 12 or below, and stand if your total hand value is 13 or above.- If you have two card values that are far apart (e.g 9 and 3), always stand no matter what your total hand value is.- In any other situation where you are not sure what to do, always hit if your total hand value is below 17 and stand if it is 17 or above.- Remember: if you go bust (i.e reach 22 or more), then you automatically lose – regardless of what the dealer’s final score turns out to be!</li>

So we’ve put together our top 5 tips for beginners.</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you understand the rules of the game before playing.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is probably one of the most important tips as it will help you make better decisions while playing. For instance, understanding when you can and cannot hit, double down or split will help you play smarter and potentially increase your chances of winning.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Start with smaller bets until you get a feel for the game.</li>
</ol>
<p>Blackjack can be a really exciting game but it’s important not to get carried away and bet too much money when you’re just starting out. Start with smaller bets until you get a feel for how the game works and how the odds play out. This way, you won’t lose too much money if things don’t go your way in the beginning.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Never split 10s or 5s.</li>
</ol>
<p>Splitting 10s and 5s is usually not a good idea as it decreases your chances of winning by half. For instance, if you are dealt two 10s, it’s usually best to just hit and hope for a better hand instead of splitting them up and doubling your risk. The same goes for 5s – there’s usually no point in splitting them up when there’s not much chance of getting anything better than a 20 or 25 with both cards.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Always take insurance when offered.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the dealer has an Ace showing, they will offer insurance to players – this is basically a side bet that pays out 2:1 if the dealer has blackjack (i.e. an Ace and a 10). It may seem like a risky move but it can actually be quite profitable if played correctly, so always take insurance when offered!</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Use basic strategy charts to guide your decisions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Basic strategy charts are available online or in books and they outline the best decision to make in every possible scenario while playing blackjack – this includes hitting, standing, doubling down etc.. By using basic strategy charts, you can ensure that you are making the smartest decisions possible each time which will help improve your chances of winning at blackjack!</p>
<h1 id="5-Increase-you-chances-of-winning-at-blackjack-–-follow-our-simple-guide"><a href="#5-Increase-you-chances-of-winning-at-blackjack-–-follow-our-simple-guide" class="headerlink" title="5. Increase you chances of winning at blackjack – follow our simple guide!"></a>5. Increase you chances of winning at blackjack – follow our simple guide!</h1><p>If you are looking to increase your chances of winning at blackjack, then you have come to the right place! Our simple guide will teach you everything you need to know in order to improve your game. So, without further ado, let’s get started!</p>
<p>Firstly, it is important to understand the basic rules of blackjack. This will help you make better decisions while playing and give you a better chance of winning. The aim of the game is to achieve a total score that is higher than that of the dealer, without going over 21. You can achieve this by either hitting (taking another card) or standing (stopping). If your total score is higher than the dealer’s, you win!</p>
<p>Once you have a good understanding of the basics, it is time to start learning some strategy. One of the most important things to remember is to never go over 21 – this is known as busting. If you do bust, you lose automatically regardless of what the dealer has. Another thing to keep in mind is whether or not to hit or stand on specific hands. For example, if you are dealt an ace and a ten-card (known as a blackjack), it is usually best to stand as your chances of winning are quite high. However, if you are dealt two eights, it may be wise to hit as your chances of getting a third eight are good. As with any game of chance, it is important to make informed decisions based on probability rather than gut instinct.</p>
<p>When playing blackjack online, there are a few additional things worth keeping in mind. Firstly, always make sure that you are playing at a reputable casino with a solid reputation. This way, you can be assured that the games are fair and that your money is safe. Secondly, be sure to familiarize yourself with the different bet types available. This will allow you to choose bets that give you the best odds of winning. Finally, make sure that you set yourself limits and only gamble what you can afford to lose. Gambling should always be fun and recreational – never let it become a source of stress or financial problems!</p>
