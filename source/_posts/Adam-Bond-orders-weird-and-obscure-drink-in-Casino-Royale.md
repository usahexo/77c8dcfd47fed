#  Adam Bond orders weird and obscure drink in Casino Royale

In the 2006 film Casino Royale, James Bond orders a drink called a Vesper. The Vesper is made up of three ingredients: gin, vodka and Lillet Blanc.

Adam Bond was curious to try this unique drink and ordered one at his local casino. He wasn't sure what to expect but the Vesper tasted surprisingly good. It was light and refreshing, with a subtle sweetness that offset the alcoholic content nicely.

Since trying the Vesper, Adam Bond has become a big fan of it and often orders it when he's playing poker or blackjack at the casino. He's even started making them at home for himself and his friends. If you're looking for something different to add to your cocktail repertoire, then be sure to give the Vesper a try.

#  Adam Bond's drink order shocks everyone in Casino Royale

In the 2006 movie Casino Royale, super spy James Bond is seen enjoying a drink at the casino table. His choice of drink order shocks everyone in the room.

 instead of ordering a vodka martini shaken, not stirred, as is his usual preference, Bond orders an iced Vesper with Lillet Blanc and gin.

The unconventional drink order confuses and intrigues everyone in the room, and Bond's fellow players even begin to doubt his suitability for the high-stakes game they're playing.

But Bond is not one to be fazed by such things, and he goes on to win big at the table that night.

The Vesper has since become something of a signature drink for 007, and it's popularity has grown in recent years as bartenders around the world have begun to experiment with different variations of the recipe.

#  What drink did Adam Bond order at Casino Royale?

When Bond is first introduced to the audience, he's enjoying a drink at Casino Royale. So what drink did he order?

There are various reports on the internet, with some Bond fans believing that he ordered a martini and others thinking that he enjoyed a vodka rocks. However, the most likely answer is that Bond ordered a Rob Roy.

This drink is made up of whisky, sweet vermouth and bitters, and it's fairly easy to make. It's also not too strong so it would be perfect for someone like Bond who likes to enjoy a cocktail but doesn't want something that's going to knock him out.

The Rob Roy has been around since the 1800s and it was named after Scottish hero Robert Roy MacGregor. It's definitely a drink that Bond would approve of and it's one of our favourites here at Casino Royale!

#  Did Adam Bond order a beer or a cocktail at Casino Royale?

It has long been debated whether or not secret agent Adam Bond (played by Daniel Craig) orders a beer or a cocktail at Casino Royale. Some say that the bartender asks what he wants and then Bond replies "I'll have a beer, please," while others believe that he says "I'll have a martini, shaken not stirred" when asked what he'd like to drink.

So what is the truth?

Well, after careful analysis of the footage, it appears as though Bond originally orders a beer but then decides to switch to a martini after getting a closer look at the menu.
