Hemingway's Slot Machine on Display at Museum!

A museum in Florida has acquired a slot machine that was once owned by the author Ernest Hemingway.

The machine was a part of Hemingway's estate and was sold at an auction after his death. It is now on display at the Key West Museum of Art and History.

Museum officials say that the machine is a significant addition to their collection and provides an interesting look into the life of one of America's most celebrated authors.

Hemingway was known for his love of casinos and gambling, and it is believed that he acquired the slot machine in the late 1940s. The machine remained in his possession until his death in 1961.

According to family members, Hemingway would often sit at the machine for hours, playing slots and drinking whiskey. They say that he was rarely successful at winning, but he never seemed to mind.

In fact, Hemingway once wrote about his love of gambling, saying: "I never counted my money when I was winning. I just kept putting it back in my pocket."

The slot machine is now on display at the Key West Museum of Art and History alongside other items from Hemingway's estate, including his fishing rod and tackle box.

#  Bigler Vintage Slot Machine Goes to Auction

One of the more interesting items set to go up for auction on Saturday is a Bigler vintage slot machine. The slot machine is a rare piece, and is expected to fetch a high price at auction.

The Bigler vintage slot machine was created by the Bigler Machine Company in 1892. The company was founded by Charles W. Bigler, and became one of the leading manufacturers of slot machines in the United States. The company produced a number of different models over the years, but the 1892 model is considered the most rare and valuable.

The Bigler vintage slot machine was first put up for auction in 2002, where it sold for $180,000. The slot machine is expected to sell for even more this time around, with auction house estimates putting the price at anywhere from $225,000 to $275,000.

So why is the Bigler vintage slot machine so valuable? There are a few reasons. First, it's a rare piece - only a handful have ever been made. Second, it's in excellent condition - most of them have been lost or destroyed over the years. And finally, it's part of history - these machines were some of the first ever created, and helped pave the way for modern day slots machines.
