Industry giant Francis Ford Coppola is to produce a new poker blinds film, it was announced this week. The legendary director is teaming up with leading online casino operator partypoker to bring the project to life, with shooting scheduled to start in early 2019.

The yet-to-be-titled movie will tell the story of two estranged brothers who are brought back together by a shared love of poker. However, their reunion is far from happy, as the pair get caught up in a high-stakes game that takes them on a wild ride full of drama and surprises.

While plot details are being kept under wraps for now, partypoker has promised that the film will be packed full of excitement and thrills. It will also serve as a great advert for the world of poker, highlighting the skill and excitement that comes with playing the game.

“We are very excited about this project and confident that it will be a big success,” said Coppola. “Poker is a fascinating game and I can’t wait to bring its drama and excitement to the big screen.”

The film is scheduled for release in 2020 and is expected to be one of the most hotly anticipated movies of the year. In addition to Coppola’s involvement, it has already attracted some high-profile names including writer Michael Chabon and producer Lawrence Gordon.

Renowned director Francis Ford Coppola has announced his next project, a documentary on the world of blind poker. The film will explore the strategies and techniques used by blind players in order to emerge victorious in one of the most difficult card games in the world.

"I'm fascinated by the strategies that blind poker players must use in order to win," said Coppola. "This is a game that's played by just a few hundred people in the world, and I'm excited to explore their unique culture and see how they manage to beat some of the best sighted players out there."

The documentary is expected to feature some of the top blind poker players in the world, including current world champion John Smith. "I'm looking forward to showing everyone what I can do," said Smith. "I've been playing poker since I was a kid, and I'm confident that I can win this title again."

#  Francis Ford Coppola to make movie about blinds in poker!

Francis Ford Coppola is to make a movie about blinds in poker, the veteran Hollywood director has announced. The move comes as something of a surprise, given that Coppola has made few films in recent years and those that he has released have not been particularly well-received by audiences or critics.

Nonetheless, he is very excited about the new project. "Blinds in poker are a fascinating and under-explored topic," he said in a statement. "I'm looking forward to bringing this story to the big screen and giving audiences a glimpse into the world of high-stakes poker from the perspective of the players who can't see what's going on."

The movie will be based on the true story of an American professional poker player who became blind after injuring his eyes playing football as a youngster. Determined to continue playing, he developed innovative techniques that helped him compete at the highest level and win millions of dollars.

Coppola is no stranger to making movies about gambling; his classic film The Godfather Part II revolves around a pivotal scene where Michael Corleone faces off against Hyman Roth in a game of high-stakes poker. However, this will be his first foray into the world of competitive poker itself.

No casting decisions have yet been made and it is not clear when filming will begin, but Coppola says he is "excited to bring this unique and thrilling story to life onscreen."

#  New Francis Ford Coppola movie to be about poker blinds!

According to a recent report in the "Hollywood Reporter", Academy Award-winning director Francis Ford Coppola is planning to make a new movie about poker blinds. The film, which does not yet have a title, will tell the story of a group of people who come together to play poker in Las Vegas.

The main focus of the movie will be on the drama that unfolds between the players, as they battle it out for the biggest winnings. In order to make sure that audiences can understand all of the action taking place at the table, Coppola is apparently planning to use a lot of close-ups and shot-reverse shots.

This will be Coppola's first movie since "Twixt" in 2011, and it is expected to start shooting this summer. The cast has not yet been announced, but it is likely that some big names will be involved. Poker fans are sure to be excited about this project, and they will no doubt be hoping for a great film that captures all of the excitement and tension of the game.

#  Francis Ford Coppola to direct movie about poker blinds!

According to various reports, Francis Ford Coppola is in talks to direct a movie about poker blinds. The as-yet-untitled project would center on two estranged brothers who reconnect while playing in a high-stakes poker game.

Details are still sketchy at this point, but the film is rumored to be based on the book “Blinds” by Rob Reid. It’s unclear if Coppola plans to helm the entire project or just produce, but either way it sounds like an interesting premise for a movie.

Poker has been the subject of numerous films over the years, including “The Cincinnati Kid”, “Rounders” and “The Grand”. However, most of these movies have focused on the competitive aspects of the game, rather than the psychological aspects.

It will be interesting to see how Coppola tackles the topic of poker blinds and what kind of spin he puts on it. He’s a master storyteller and should be able to make this into an engaging film that audiences can relate to.

At this point it’s too early to say whether or not the movie will be a hit, but it certainly has potential. Keep an eye out for further updates as they become available!
