A few weeks later, Mikki went one better by taking down the $109 buy-in Sunday Kickoff on PokerStars for an impressive $10,710 payday.

This was followed up by another final table appearance in a major online tournament in May 2017, when Mikki finished 7th in the $1,050 buy-in World Championship of Online Poker (WCOOP) Event #32 for a prize of $14,556.
