#  More People Will Gamble in Arizona, with Legalized Gambling

The Arizona State Legislature has passed a bill that would legalize gambling in the state. This opens up opportunities for casinos, as well as other types of gambling, such as internet gambling and lottery games. The bill now goes to the desk of Governor Doug Ducey for his signature.

Supporters of the measure say that it will generate much-needed revenue for the state. They also argue that it will create jobs and bring tourists to Arizona. Opponents of the measure claim that it will lead to increased crime and social ills.

Governor Ducey has not announced whether he will sign the bill into law or not. However, if he does approve it, then more people in Arizona are likely to gamble in the near future.

#  Arizonans Can Gamble for Fun Starting Today

In a unanimous vote Tuesday, the Arizona state senate voted to allow Arizonans to gamble for fun. This new law will go into effect immediately and will allow people over the age of 21 to gamble in casinos, on horse races, and at state- run lottery outlets.

Senators said that this new law would help generate revenue for the state budget and create jobs. Opponents of the measure argued that it would increase addiction and poverty rates in the state.

Governor Doug Ducey is expected to sign the bill into law.

#  Arizona is One Step Closer to Allowing Gambling 

On Monday, the Arizona Senate passed a bill that would allow gambling in the state. The move is a major shift for Arizona, which has traditionally been opposed to gambling. If the bill is approved by the House and signed into law by Governor Doug Ducey, it would allow casinos to be built in Phoenix and Tucson.

Supporters of the bill say that it will bring much-needed revenue to the state. Opponents argue that gambling is addictive and can lead to financial ruin for many people.

The debate over gambling in Arizona has been going on for many years. In 2006, a ballot initiative to allow casino gambling was narrowly defeated. In 2017, a similar measure was also defeated. This year, however, things may be different. The bill passed the Senate by a vote of 18-12 and has the support of Governor Ducey.

If the bill becomes law, it will be up to the individual cities whether or not to allow casinos. Tucson Mayor Jonathan Rothschild has already voiced his support for the measure, while Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton is opposed to it.

Gambling has become increasingly popular in recent years. In states where gambling is legal, it accounts for a significant percentage of revenue. In Nevada, for example, gambling accounts for more than one-third of all revenue generated by the state government.

Casinos are not just popular with tourists; they are also popular with residents. In Connecticut, for example, more than half of all casino revenue comes from residents of the state.

There are pros and cons to allowing gambling in Arizona. On one hand, it could bring much-needed revenue to the state. On the other hand, it could lead to addiction and financial ruin for many people. Only time will tell whether or not this bill becomes law

#  Gambling Now Legal in More Places in Arizona

In a historic move, the governor of Arizona has signed a bill into law that legalizes gambling across the state. This comes as great news to the many Arizonans who enjoy gambling and should provide a considerable boost to the state's economy.

The new law allows casinos, racetracks, and other gambling venues to open up in any city or town in Arizona. There is no longer any need to drive to Las Vegas or another state in order to gamble. This will likely lead to an increase in tourism, as people from all over will flock to Arizona to try their luck at the casino or race track.

Local business owners are already anticipating a windfall. "I can't wait for the casino to open up in my town," said one small business owner. "This is going to be huge for us."

The governor and other supporters of the bill believe that it will create thousands of jobs and bring in millions of dollars in tax revenue. "This is a great day for Arizona," said the governor. "We are finally catching up with the rest of the country."

Gambling has been legal in some form or another in most states for many years now, but it has always been frowned upon by many people. With this new law, Arizona is embracing gambling and showing that it is here to stay. Whether you love it or hate it, there's no doubt that gambling is big business and good for the economy.

#  Get Ready to Gamble, Arizona!



The Arizona state legislature is currently considering a measure that would allow for casino gambling in the Grand Canyon State. The bill – HB2244 – was introduced by state representative T.J. Shope and has been assigned to the House Committee on Gaming, Industry and Economic Development. If it passes, the bill would allow for 10 new casinos to be built in Arizona.

At present, there are just five casinos in the entire state of Arizona, and they are all located in Native American reservations. The new casinos would be spread out across the state, including in Tucson, Phoenix and Flagstaff.

If the bill passes, it is expected to generate hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue for the state of Arizona every year. It would also create thousands of new jobs in the hospitality industry.

Opponents of the bill argue that it will lead to an increase in crime and addiction rates, but supporters say that those risks are worth taking in order to generate much-needed revenue for the state.

The fate of HB2244 is still up in the air, but it is likely to face a heated debate in the months ahead. Check back for updates on this important piece of legislation!
