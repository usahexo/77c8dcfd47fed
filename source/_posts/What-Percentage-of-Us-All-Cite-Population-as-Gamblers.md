#  What Percentage of Us All Cite Population as Gamblers?

Casino players come from all walks of life. Statistically, some percentage of the population at any given time is gambling. This ranges from those who occasional visit a casino or racetrack, to the regular player who bets on games of chance. Whether for recreation or as a serious hobby, gambling is a popular pastime for many people around the world.

In the United States, where gambling has been legal since the early 1800s, it is estimated that two-thirds of the population has gambled at some point in their lives. According to The American Gambling Association (AGA), between 35 and 40 million Americans visit casinos every year and another 40 to 50 million bet on sports legally. That’s about half of the adult population!

Gambling addiction is a growing problem in the U.S. and around the world. The National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) reports that approximately 2 percent of Americans (or approximately 4 to 6 million people) meet the diagnostic criteria for pathological gambling. This type of addiction can have serious consequences including financial ruin, job loss, family discord and even suicide.

Despite the potential risks, most people who gamble do so without any major problems. For most people, gambling is an enjoyable way to spend free time or money. It can add excitement to live events like horse races or football games, and can be a fun way to socialize with friends. So whether you’re a casual gambler or a diehard enthusiast, enjoy your favorite form of gambling responsibly and have some fun!

#  Do You Love Gambling? Chances Are, You're Not Alone!

Gambling can be a fun and thrilling experience, but it can also be addicting. According to the National Council on Problem Gambling, about 2 percent of the adult population experiences gambling problems. That may not seem like a lot, but when you consider that there are over 230 million adults in the United States, that's over 4.6 million people who might have a problem with gambling.

So, why do so many people love gambling? There are probably a number of reasons. For some, it's the thrill of potentially winning big money. For others, it's the excitement of taking risks. And for some people, gambling can simply be a way to escape from their everyday life.

If you're someone who loves gambling, it's important to be aware of the risks involved. Gambling can lead to financial problems, relationship problems, and even addiction. If you think you might have a problem with gambling, it's important to seek help. There are many organizations that can help you get started, including the National Council on Problem Gambling and Gamblers Anonymous.

#  The percentage of us who gamble is actually quite high 

Though gambling is often thought of as a vice that only a small percentage of the population participates in, the reality is that a much larger number of people gamble than many would think. In fact, according to a study from The Economist, around 53 percent of Americans engage in some form of gambling in a given year.

This covers a wide range of activities, from playing the lottery to betting on sports. And while this may not seem like a lot, it’s actually more than half of the population. So if you’re one of the people who doesn’t gamble, there’s a good chance you know someone who does.

Gambling can be an enjoyable way to pass the time or to try and win some extra money. But it can also be addictive and harmful, leading some people to ruin their lives financially and emotionally.

So whether you’re someone who gambles occasionally or someone who struggles with addiction, it’s important to be aware of the risks involved and to take steps to protect yourself.

#  Americans love gambling and casino games - study

A new study reveals that most Americans love gambling and casino games. The research, which was conducted by the University of Pennsylvania, is the first of its kind to explore public attitudes towards gambling.

The study found that more than 60 percent of Americans expressed a positive attitude towards gambling. In particular, people who gamble enjoy the thrill of taking risks and the social aspects of playing casino games with friends.

The research also shed light on why people gamble. Most people said they gamble for entertainment purposes, while others said they gamble to win money. Interestingly, very few people said they gamble because they have a problem with gambling addiction.

The study's lead author, Dr. Christopher Lewis, said the findings could help inform public policy on gambling. "These findings suggest that policymakers should be cautious in their attempts to restrict or prohibit gambling," he said. "Instead, they should focus on ensuring that gambling is safe and fun for everyone."

In light of these findings, it's clear that gambling is here to stay in America. So if you're looking for a fun and exciting way to spend your time, be sure to check out your local casino!

#  Gates: US has an immoral love affair with gambling

Former finance minister of the United States, Bill Gates, has criticised the country's love affair with gambling, describing it as immoral.

"The US has an immoral love affair with gambling"

Gates was speaking at an event in Seattle, Washington, organised by the anti-gambling group Facing History and Ourselves. He said that while there were some benefits to gambling, they were far outweighed by the harms.

"When it comes to gambling, we are seeing a lot of negative effects - in terms of social ills, people being taken advantage of, and state budgets being affected," said Gates. "It's way past time for us to take a serious look at this issue."

Gates is not the first high-profile figure to criticise gambling. In 2015, Pope Francis described it as a "mortal sin", saying that it destroyed families and caused people to become addicted.

Critics argue that gambling is addictive and can lead to financial ruin for those who lose money on it. They also say that it can cause crime rates to increase as people turn to criminal activity in order to feed their addiction.

Supporters of gambling argue that it can be a fun and harmless way to pass the time, and that it can be profitable for casinos and state governments. They also say that it can be used to raise money for good causes such as education or health care.
