Rabona is a type of kick that is used in association football. It is an unusual move that involves kicking the ball with the inside of the foot - around the ankle area - instead of using the laces.

The rabona has been used by some of the best players in the world, including Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar. It is a difficult move to execute and can catch defenders off guard.

Regardless of when it was first invented, the rabona has become increasingly popular in recent years, thanks to some of the top players using it to great effect.

#  What does Rabona mean in Spanish?

Rabona is a Spanish word that means 'to kick with the outside of the foot.' This term is most commonly used in association with a football move that sees a player kicking the ball behind their standing leg with the outside of their other foot.

#  How did Valencia CF and Pound come to be associated with Rabona?

The rabona is a type of kick in association football, invented by Argentine player Enrique Omar Sívori. The kick involves striking the ball behind the kicking leg with the trailing foot, then quickly bringing that foot up and around the ball to hit it on the other side.

The term "rabona" is derived from the Spanish word "rabonar", which means "to do a rabona". It was given this name because of Argentinian player Enrique Omar Sívori's habit of performing the move.

There are many famous players who have successfully pulled off a rabona during their career, including Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar and Gareth Bale. One of the most famous examples of a successful rabona is Diego Maradona's goal against England at the 1986 World Cup.

Rabonas are often used as a showboating trick or as a way to surprise the opposing goalkeeper. They are not always successful, however, as John Terry's missed attempt for Chelsea in their Champions League semi-final against Barcelona in 2009 demonstrated.

Despite its occasional success, the rabona remains a risky move and can often result in an embarrassing own goal if it goes wrong. As former Juventus and Italy striker Alessandro Del Piero once said: "The rabona is like sex – even when it's bad, it's still good."
