#  How do I play the Super Sweets Game? 

The Super Sweets Game is a challenging puzzle game that tests your problem solving skills. The objective of the game is to guide a piece of candy from the starting position to the exit, using only vertical and horizontal movements.

To play, you must first select a level to play. There are currently 50 levels available, and more will be added in future updates. Each level has a different set of obstacles for you to overcome.

To move the candy, use the arrow keys on your keyboard. To switch between vertical and horizontal movement, press the V or H keys. When the candy is positioned in the desired spot, press the spacebar to make it bounce off the wall.

There are a number of things to keep in mind while playing Super Sweets Game:

- You can only move the candy horizontally or vertically. It cannot move diagonally.

- The candy can only bounce off of walls that are directly perpendicular to its current direction of movement.

- If the candy reaches the exit, it will automatically be teleported to the next level. However, if it falls off of the screen, you will lose a life and have to start over from the beginning of the level.

#  What are the rules of the Super Sweets Game?

The Super Sweets Game is a fast-paced candy matching game that is easy to learn but difficult to master. The basic premise of the game is to match up 3 or more of the same type of candy in a row or column to clear them from the board. If you get stuck, you can use one of your limited number of “jelly beans” to help you out.

The game has 5 different levels, each with its own set of rules. In level 1, all you need to do is match up 3 or more of the same type of candy. In level 2, you need to match up the shapes of the candies as well. In level 3, you need to match up 3 or more of the same color and shape. In level 4, you need to make chains of candy by connecting 4 or more of the same type of candy together. In level 5, you will be playing against the clock and trying to get as many points as possible before time runs out.

In order to advance to the next level, you must complete the required number of levels first. There are also bonus levels that can be unlocked by getting a certain number of stars. To get a star, you need to earn at least 75% of the points possible in each level.

The Super Sweets Game is available for free on Google Play and the App Store.
