#  Gambling magnate newest owner of Rock Vegas Casino

Gambling magnate Sheldon Adelson is the newest owner of the Rock Vegas Casino. The purchase price was not released, but industry analysts put it at around $1.2 billion.

The casino is one of the largest in the world, with more than 150,000 square feet of gaming space. It features 2,500 slot machines and 150 table games.

Adelson is one of the richest men in the world, with a net worth estimated at $26.5 billion. He made his fortune in the gambling industry, and is the founder and CEO of the Las Vegas Sands Corporation.

The Rock Vegas Casino is one of several properties that Adelson owns in Las Vegas. He also owns the Venetian Resort Hotel Casino, The Palazzo Resort Hotel Casino, and The Mirage Hotel Casino.

Adelson has made no secret of his plans to expand his gambling empire into other states. In addition to his casinos in Las Vegas, he operates casinos in Singapore and Macau. He is currently building a $1.9 billion casino resort in Pennsylvania, which is scheduled to open next year.

Industry analysts say that Adelson is buying up casinos at a time when the industry is undergoing a consolidation phase. Many smaller casinos are being acquired by larger companies, and Adelson clearly wants to be part of that trend.
